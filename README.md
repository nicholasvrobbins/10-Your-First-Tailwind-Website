Followed along with Traversy Media Tailwind walkthrough on creating a website utilizing Tailwind (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRagrTU_v8o)

Live Demo: 

Learned more about properly setting up Tailwind, config file, etc.,

Learned more about using padding and margin to create spacing between elements, fully realizing how divs inside divs stack and create elements that you can use flex or a framework to move around. 

Utilized hover effects more, made the sight responsive and really enjoyed using Tailwind!
